####User stories:

Dan is an avid fan of the Dallas Cowboys. He is passionate about the team and wishes that he could view what other Cowboy fans have to say about the team. While googling, he comes across Sportvine, curious about the product. He browses through the sport feed dashboard and filters it to show only Dallas Cowboy material. He then proceeds to waste an hour watching peopleâ€™s Vine videos about the Cowboys

Jennifer really likes the Arizona Cardinals. She hears about Sportvine from Dan. She goes to the dashboard, and filters out the feed for only Cardinals. She just wants to see gifs and tweets. She further filters the dashboard to only show tweets and gifs

Chris likes the Cardinals too, and wants to save the cool gifs he sees on the site for future viewing. He makes an account on Sportvine and saves a couple cool gifs to his account. These gifs appear on his profile page.
